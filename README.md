## üöÄ Getting Started

You can run this application using Docker (recommended) or directly with Gradle. Choose the approach that best fits your needs.

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose (for containerized approach)
- Java 21 or higher (for Gradle approach)
- Gradle (for Gradle approach)
- PostgreSQL (for Gradle approach)

### Option 1: Running with Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the complete application with all services:

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd store-backend-java
   ```

2. Start all services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   This builds and starts all microservices with their dedicated databases.

3. Access services at their respective ports (8080-8086)

To stop all services:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Option 2: Running with Gradle

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd store-backend-java
   ```

2. Configure separate databases for each service (e.g., item_db, image_db, etc.)

3. Build the services:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

4. Run each service:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :<service-name>:bootRun
   ```

## üì¶ Service Configuration

### Docker Setup
When using Docker, the configuration is handled through environment variables in docker-compose.yml and .env file. Each service has its own dedicated PostgreSQL database with unique ports (5432-5438).

### Gradle Setup
Each service has its own configuration properties in `application.properties/yaml` including database connections, server ports, and service-specific settings.

## üìù API Documentation

Each service exposes its own REST API endpoints. Access the OpenAPI documentation at:
```
http://<service-host>:<port>/swagger-ui.html
```

For example:
- Item Service: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
- Image Service: http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html
- Opinion Service: http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui.html

## üîß Environment Variables

When using Docker, you can configure the services by modifying the `.env` file with:
- Database credentials
- Service ports
- Other service-specific settings

## üîç Monitoring & Logs

### Docker Setup
Monitor logs using Docker commands:
```bash
docker-compose logs                   # All services
docker-compose logs <service-name>    # Specific service
docker-compose logs -f <service-name> # Follow logs
```

### Gradle Setup
When running with Gradle, logs will be available in the console and log files.

## üì¶ Service Dependencies

- Docker & Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)
- Java 21 or higher
- Gradle
- PostgreSQL
